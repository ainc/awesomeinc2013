						          <p><b>Nathan Fort</b><br>Nathan co-founded Awesome Inc. in 2008 to create, improve, and expand the entrepreneur community in the Bluegrass. During his undergraduate studies, Nathan teamed up with co-founders Brian Raney and Luke Murray to expand the UK Bookexchange into a nationwide service, Bookexchange.com. He has a passion for business and an entrepreneur spirit to match. Nathan will graduate from the University of Louisville Brandeis School of Law in Spring 2012, where he will focus on business planning, mergers and acquisitions, and securities regulations. During law school Nathan has worked extensively on patent research and intellectually property issues. He is a member of the University of Louisville Law Review, Moot Court Board Director/Competitor, and a trained mediator. He volunteers in his free time as a mediator for the Jefferson County Court. When Nathan is not reading or studying, he enjoys fiddling with technology, investment trading, and traveling.</p><br><br>
						        
								<img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/founders/lukemurray.jpg">
								  <p><b>Luke Murray</b><br>Luke graduated from UK a year early summa cum laude with a BS in the Business Administration of Medicine in 2004 and started Bookexchange.com with Brian Raney that same year. He received his MBA from UK, in 2006, again graduating summa cum laude. He worked for UK hospital from 2006-2007 in process improvement, then the Southwestern Company in the summer of 2007, finishing in the top 2% of salespeople. He started Awesome Inc with Brian Raney in the Spring of 2009 with the goal of attracting and retaining the highest potential people in the areas of technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship. Luke completed Medical School at the University of Kentucky in 2013. He likes to play guitar and piano...and to talk too much sometimes.</p><br><br>
								  <img class="img-responsive" src="/assets/img/founders/brianraney.jpg">
								   <p><b>Brian Raney</b><br>After earning a Computer Science degree from the University of Kentucky, Brian completed his Master’s Degree in Economics. Brian founded his first software company, Sfenity, before graduating from college. After overseeing its merger with APAX Software, Brian served as the company’s CEO through its transition from a small web design firm to a top resource for mobile app development. Brian co-founded the Young Entrepreneurs of Lexington organization in 2008, before founding Awesome Inc, a startup accelerator and entrepreneur epicenter in 2009. He was honored as the Lexington Young Entrepreneur of the Year in 2010. Brian also serves as the Entrepreneur in Residence at the University of Kentucky. He coaches competitive soccer and is a phenomenal ping pong player.</p><br><br>

								   <p><b>Nick Such</b><br>Nick helped launch Awesome Labs to better connect collegiate engineering students with entrepreneurial opportunities. An alumnus of the University of Kentucky's College of Engineering, Nick led the UK Solar Car Team to it's highest ever finish: 2nd place at FSGP 2009. Before Awesome Inc, he gained engineering and venture capital experience with GE, Toyota, and KSTC. For a few years, Nick thought that he wanted to get an MBA, but after gaining admission offers from Harvard and Stanford, he turned down both to continue pursuing BuildingLayer, a startup that evolved from out of the first class of the Awesome Labs program. Nick also enjoys riding all types of bicycles, "reading" audiobooks, and blogging, but seldom all three simultaneously.</p><br><br>

							  <h1>Team Alpha</h1>

		  					<p>Are you looking for an internship? Does being paid in doughnuts sound awesome to you? Do you want to join the coolest team in town? Apply to be a part of Team Alpha today!<br>
		  						<br><br><b>Who We Are</b><br>

		  						Team Alpha is Awesome Inc's group of interns, but don't let them hear you call them that. Besides working at the most exciting place in town, Team Alpha members have the opportunities, resources, and mentorships to pursue their passions. For example, Tyler Green, aka Green T, not only does web development for Awesome Inc websites, he created his own, Stadium Fanatic.

		  						<br><br><b>Why We're Awesome</b><br>

		  						<p>Team Alpha currently has around twenty members. Team Alpha's leader, Garrett, is way more fun than any other boss you'll have. Charlotte, Team Alpha's youngest member, can be seen riding her unicycle throughout the space. Our video team gets to hang out with millionaires, like the Dippin' Dots inventor and the founder of Papa John's for their work on Founders Series.  And our programming team gets to work on sweet mobile apps and learn to code cool website by developing and maintaining sites such as 5Across.org, AwesomeIncU.com, and our main site - AwesomeInc.org.

		  						<br><br><b>What We Need</b><br>

		  						We're looking for anyone who wants to have fun and follow Rule # 4 - Always do something awesome over something not awesome. Our primary need is for people interested in social media, video, web development, and graphic design. We also need event coordinators, marketing and PR people, and writers.

		  						<br><br><b>Why You Should Join?</b><br>

		  						While you won't get paid with cash money, you will get free doughnuts, a free T-shirt, and awesome opportunities you won't get at other jobs. Also, if you're good enough, you too can get a sweet nickname like Party, Cool, Thunder, Focus and Green T did.</p><br>

						<b>Here's a quick list of anecdotes of how people have benefitted from using our space in the past:</b><br><br>
						<b>Waste less time troubleshooting:</b> An entrepreneur working on a video tutorial site was having trouble getting a YouTube customization feature to work with his website. He spent the whole morning searching through StackOverflow, but couldn't find an appropriate answer. He asked one of his fellow tenants, and had the problem fixed within 15 minutes.
						<br>
						<b>Resources in the same room:</b> one of our long-time tenants was looking for a new website for one of his company's products. He's a marketer and normally works with a software team in Mexico, but needed something up really quickly. Fortunately, there was a designer/developer who specialized in Wordpress & Drupal sites who was working out at Awesome Inc that month. They connected and got the new site done quickly, on budget, and with the necessary design revisions that made were easy because they could meet daily.
						<br>
						<b>Find out about the latest stuff:</b> Our first Social Media and Community Manager was on Twitter before SXSW in 2007, which led to a lot of us getting on early. We have developers for Apax doing things with Node.js and Meteor.js (not even at v1 yet), which allowed an Awesome Inc member to do a demo for students at the STEAM Academy. Somebody is always dabbling with a new web service, project management tool, hardware hack, or beta OS.
						<br>
						<b>Entrepreneurial culture:</b> we don't publicly highlight this (because most people don't grok it quickly), but what we really do at Awesome Inc is best described as "ballsprouting". Most people struggle getting out of their comfort zones, which limits the opportunities they can know about and seize. Our 5 Across pitch contest gets people out of their basement to share their crazy idea with 50 people. Our Awesome Inc U classes get people to try the often scary task of writing your first lines of code. The Cherub Fund gets people to try out their first angel investments. We also help people to "fire bullets before canon balls", making sure that these are small, survivable risks.
						<br>
						<b>Random interactions with our community:</b> on an average Tuesday night, there are about 20 tiny ballerinas dancing around the front of our space. When an Awesome in member was working on a grocery shopping startup idea, the mothers and fathers of these dance students were perfect customers to interview about the product. On those same Tuesday nights, there are about 15 video game developers playing with a pre-release version of an Oculus Rift, and about 10 UK Computer Science students meeting with Awesome Labs mentors to discuss the Android app they're building for their CS Capstone Project.
						<br>
						<b>Bonus: massive improvement in Ping Pong skills. We're a competitive bunch.	</b>
