When I first came onto Team Alpha, I was a timid college sophomore who wanted to learn more design and had absolutely no clue about the startup world (or really what Awesome Inc even did).  Awesome Inc helped to give me the confidence and encouragement to work on my design skills and I learned so much there to help me get to where I am today - now immersed in the startup world of Boulder.  I wouldn't be here without them and all of their support.",
