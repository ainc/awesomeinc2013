- title: Why We're Awesome
  description: Team Alpha currently has around twenty members. Team Alpha's leader, Emily, is way more fun than any other boss you'll have. Our video team gets to hang out with millionaires, like the Dippin' Dots inventor and the founder of Papa John's for their work on the Founders Series. And our programming team gets to work on sweet mobile apps and learn to code cool websites, such as <a href="http://5across.org">5Across.org</a>, <a href="https://www.awesomeincu.com">AwesomeIncU.com</a>, and our main site--<a href="http://awesomeinc.org">AwesomeInc.org</a>.
